aible to his cause, Caesar gave him his daughter Julia in marriage,
and he himself married the daughter of L. Calpurnius Piso, who war
elected consul for the year rr. c. 57.

The province of Transalpina Gaul afforded Caesar a brilliant op-
portunity of displaying his military genius, and of attaching the army
to his person3 while at the same time be was not too far srorn Rome
to continue his connection with the city, watch the proceedings of
his enemies, and keep his friends actively engaged in promoting his
interantur sor he must have foreseen that, it the aristocracy should
ever succeed in gaining Pompey over to their side, they would not
scrupis to use soree against him. After the close of his consulship,
he remained for some time in the city; sor although his successore
in office were attached to bis cause, the praetore wanted to rcscind
his regulations3 but their attempta were useless. After quitting
Rome, he lingered for a lew months with his legions in the neigh-
bourhood os the city, with the view of supporting Clodius, who was
then tribune of the people, and had resolved to bring about the down-
tatt of Cicero. When tlte latter bad withdrawn to exile, Caesar, about
the end of April, a. c. tu, set out t‘or Gaul. We need not here give
an account of his campaigns in that country, lor they are described by
the great general himself, in the work to which this sketch is intend·
ed as an introduction. Sufficc it to say, tbat during bis administra·
tion oi Gaul, trorn a. o. 58 to a. c. 50, hc completely subdued the
country between the Rhine, the ocean, the Pyrenees, end the Alps,
notwithstanding the repeated and formidabis attempls of the inhabi-
tants to shake off the Roman yolret and that this was the first great
step towards Romanising a region in which, during the empire, the
Latin language was aa commonly spoken as in Italy. The French
language, even at this day, is a living procl to what extent Roman
erviliaation at one time prevailed in Gaul. Caesar, moreover, twice

⁴ crossed the Rhine, and twice invaded Britain, hut made no perma-

nent conquesta either in Germany or in our own island.

It is remarlred above that Caesar received his provinces t‘or five
yeare,a period which would have terminated in a. c. 543 but in a. c.
bd, while bis army was in winter quarters, he had a maeting with
Pompcy and Crassus in the north oi Italy, at which it was arranged
that Pompey should have the consulship sor the year a. c. ab, and
that asterwards they should have the provinces os Spain and Syria sor
five years each. The two, irr return, promised to procura for Caesar
the prolongation of bis administration of Gaul for iive years. This
was brought about by ahill of the tribune Trebonius ς so that Caesar’a
proconsulship of Gaul was now to be continued till the end of a. c.
49. The year alter those new arrangements‚ J ulia, the wite oi Pom
