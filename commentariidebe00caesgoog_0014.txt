‘I'aa Publishers' Notice sufficiently explains tha nature and
design of the series of which the present volume— C. Junrr
Canasnrs Connauraarr na Besso Gaanrco—forms a part. In
reference to the text, I have in the first four books adopted
that of Ο. Ε. C. Schneider (Halle, 1840, tivo), whose excellent
edition is unfortunately not completed3 while iu the remaining
three 1 have chiefly followed the edition of 0. G. Herzog (Leipzig,
1831, 8vo.). l have, however, considered it necessary to aban·
don certain peculiarities of orthography adopted hy the former
of these authorities, for, although more correct than the common
orthography, they would be perplexing to pupils who have only
the ordinary dictionaries at their command.

With respect to the notes which are to accompany the different
texts, an additional word of explanation seems desirable. Iu the
writings of every ancient author, a number of passages occur
presenting grammatical difficulties, or relating to historiari, geo·
graphical, and other particulare, which a youth cannot under-
stand without consulting a variety of hoohs3 and in the greater
number o'f instances, these books are either not athis command,
or if he does possess them, he is often ignorant of the manner
” of gethering from them the required information„ Tha object,
therefore, of the notes, and other illustratione, is to remove such
difficulties, and generally to afford an aid to those who aredis·
posed to make a reasonable exertion in mastering the subject of
their lessons. Nothing, however, can he more destructive to the
mental energias of pupils, than placing before them annotatione
on a principle of indiscriminate translation; for, instead of caus·
ing them to exart their minds, and acquire habits of exact reason-
ing and investigation-an important object in classical training
-the assistance so unduly afforded roba them of all motiva for
exertion‚ and deprives them of tha invaluable pleasurs of con·
quering difficulties, and of feeling that they have been instru· ⁴
mental in their own instruction. ·
