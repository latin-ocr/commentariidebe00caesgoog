establish his own power on a sure and legal foundation. It was
perhaps 101 this reason that he was not content with the substance
of regal power, but was anxious aleo to have the outward signs 01
royalty‚ and thereby‚ as it were, 10 legalise that which he possessed.
An attempt was accordingly made hy M. Antony to offer him the
' diadem in February nc. 44; but as the people received the pro·
posal with coolness, Caesar for the present declined the honour.
’ How much he was bent upon obtaining it, however, became manifest

ventured to manifest their disapproval of conferring upon him the

One of his great plens was to secure the eastern frontier 01 the
empire hy a war against the Parthians, 101 which some preparatione
had already been made. When the Sibylline books were consulted
respecting the undertaking, they were reported to state that the Par-
thians could be conquered only by a king; and one 01 Caesar's
friends accordingly was to bring forward a proposal in the senate,
that Caesar out of Italy should be permittsd to assume the title 01

Thus did Rome lose the only man who could have restored
peace and happiness to the state, and under whose rnild eway
she might have forgotten the woes she had been suffering
for the last fifty years. Those who pretended 10 restore free·
