pey in Spain, who managed the administration of the province for
him, and had a large army at their command. Learing M. Antony
and Lepidus behind to manage the affairs of ltaly, and sending others
of his friends to take possession of Sicily, Sardinia, end Africa, he
hastened to Spain. Some of these generals were unsuccessful3 but
their losses were more than counterbalanced hythe advantages which
Caesar himself gained. On his way, he found that the town of Mas·
cilia refused to submit to him, but, without allowing himself to bs
detained, he left two of his legates to lay siege to the place, and pro·
ceeded to Spain. He there met with great difficulties, and sustained ’
some severe reversos, hut in the end he compelled Afranius aud
Petreius to surrender: they were dismissed unhnrt, end their troops
joined those of the conqueror. The subjugation of Spain was eom·
pleted within forty days. On his return to Gaul, Massilia was still
holding out, but he soon compelled a surrender, and treated the in·
habitante with leniency and forbearance.

Before quitting Massilia, Caesar was informed that, on the proposal
of M. Lepidus, he had been appointed dictator. This had of course
been done at Gaesar's own suggestion, and he now hastened to Rome
to preside at the consular electione. Being elected one of the consuls
fer s. c. 48, he laid down his dictatorship, after haring been invested
with it only eleven days. During his stay at Rome,which was very
short, he acted as if he had been the aeknowledged sovereign of the
state, and had several beneficial lewe passed, which greatly increased
his popularity. ln December, a. c. 49, he set out for Brundusium,
where his troops were already assembled. Pompey in the meantime
had not been idle in Graece3 he had collected a large army, and great
sums of money, and his dest swayed the Mediterranean. Gaesar’e
fleat, on tbe other hand, was so small, that he could not at once
transport his troops across the Adriatic. However, he arrived with
a part of them safely in Epiruse but when he sent back the ships to
bring the remainder, they were intercepted by M. Bibulus, Pompey'a
admiral, and thus a number of the forces were obliged to romain be·
hind at Brundusium. N otwithstanding this unfortunate circumstance,
he forthwith began his operatione. He took several towns on hia
read, and hastened to Dyrrhachium, in which city Pompey kept his
atores. But Pompey reached the place before Caesar, and the hostile
armies now encamped opposite one another. In the mean time An·
tony succeeded iu carrying Caesar's troops across the Adriatic, though
not without the greatest peril. Pompey avoided a decisivo engage-
ment, and Caesar began to bloclrade him, but the fortifications had

scarcely been completed, when the former made an atteclr, and broke '

through them. Caesar sustained a considerable loss. His army he·
