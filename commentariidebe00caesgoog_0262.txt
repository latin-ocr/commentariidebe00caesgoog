'l'he object of this series is to present s course of elementary worirs suited tt
ite wants of the bertinum, as weil ss accurate texts of the more prominent
ancient writers, revised in accordance with the letest investigatione and uss
end the most approved principles ofmodern criticism. These are necompaniot
with notes nod illustratione introduced sparingly, avoiding‚ on the one hond, the
error of overburdening the work with commentnry; ond on the other, thet of
leaving the student entirely to his own resources. The muin obiect hes been to
rnaben tho scholar's mind to n sense of the besuties and peculiaritics of id·
author. to ussist him where assistance is necessary, end t'o lead him to think ind
io investigate for himself. For tbis purpose mups end other engrerings ere given
wherever useful, end esch author is sceompenied with nbiogrepbicel und eritiesi
skeich. 'ibe form in which the volumes aro printed is neat and convenient,
while it admits of their being sold et prices unprecedentediy low, thus placing
them within the reeeb of musy to whom the eost of classicel works hes hitherto
proved s bar to this department of study. lt will be seen, therefore, that the
