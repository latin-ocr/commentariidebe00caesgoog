before quitting Rome. The wealtby Crassus and other friends be-
came security for him; and matters being thus arranged, be set out
for his province. He was now, for the first time, at the head of an
army, aod in a short time, like a true military genius, be at once
displayed all the qualities of a great general. After having sub-
dued some of tbe mountain tribes of Lusitania. and taken Brigan-
tium, a town of the Gallaeci, be returned to Rome. The money
he had collected in Spain enabled him to pay his debts, and in a. c.
60 he offered himself as a candidata for the consulship. His own
influence and popularlty‚ and the supportes Pompey, secured his
election3 but the aristocrats‚ by immensa exertion and bribery‚ con-
trived to obtain the appointment of M. Bibulus, a stout champion of
their party, as his colleague. Pompey had before this time defini-
tively joined the popular party3 for, on his return from the Mithri·
datic war, the senate refused to ratify tbe regulations which he had
made in Asia, and Caesar promised him by and by to compel its
sanction. After his electiori, Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus formed
an alliance, io which they agreed to support one another3 their union
rendered them invincible‚ and they accordingly had the fate of the
republic in their hands. The year of Caesar's consulship is remark·

the senate to publish the reports of its proceediogs‚ whereby it became

the firmest hold on the attachment of the people3 and his nex-t mea·

in their eagerness to obtain contracte for raising the public revanua
in the provinces, had offered larger sums than they could afford, and
Caesar now prevailed upon the people to relieve them of one-third
of their payment. After this he induced the senate to sanction tha
regulations of Pompey in Asia. The senate bad assigned to Cacsar
a province from which neither fame nor gain could be derived; but
as he had now secured tbe support of tbe people, the equites, and
Pompey, he prevailed upon the tribune Vatinius to propose to the
people that, atter the expiration of bis consulship, he should receive
the administration of Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum for five years.
The bill was passed; and the senate, of its own accord, added tha pro-
