ha was pardoned through the mediation of the vestal virgins and some
of his friends3 though Sulla forgave him with reluctauce, remarking
that this young man would be the ruin of the aristocracy, for that
many Mariuses were slumbering in him.

Instead of remaining at home, Caesar preferred sarving in the
army, which was then engaged in Asia Minor3 and ha theresa much
distinguished himself, that he was rewarded with a civic crown. In
