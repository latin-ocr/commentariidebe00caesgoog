'l'nrr study ol Greek and Roman literature is usually considered
an indispensable branch of a liberal education. By offering to
the young the contemplation ol great minds, as reflected in the
works ol the classic authors of antiquity, it extends the range ot'
ideas, and becomes aspecies of intellectual training, which, though
differing from, is not inferior to, that imparted by the study of
the exact sciences. Besides these advantages, an acquaintance
, with the languages of ancient Grecos and Rome is desirable, on
account of the extent to which they enter tnto the formation ol
eur own and other European tongues, aa well aa into tte con·
struction of all scientific nomenclatura.

Latterly, a disposition hasbeen manifested te undervalue clas-
sical attainments, but this may bs salely ascribed less to the de·
munds made by other branches ol learning, than to the manner in
which Greek and Latin have usually been imparted. Everything
may be carried to excess; und it cannot be doubted that the prac-
tice ol teaching these languages as mere verbal acquirements‚ to the
exclusion of things more directly avallable' rn active life, has done,
incalculable damage to the principles ol a liberal education. To

. restore the Classica to their proper place, all that seems necessary
⁵. is, to make them a part, not the whole, of school instruction, thus

allowing time and opportunity lor acquiring the elementa os those
arts and sciences without which any system os modern tuition
would be faulty and incompleta. To aid this desirable object, it
appears te ns that nothing is more wanted than an improved
series of school-books, by which the study may be facilitated, and
rendered attractiva, instead of an object of aversion, as bere-
tosore, to learners. An effert must be made to help pupils over

· difficulties which unduly retard their progress, and unnecessarily

consume their time. Such an effort is the intended Gatasmira
Sscarorr of Gnamaens’s Ennoea-ronan Cannae.

Influenced by a desire to offers rn the first place, aseries os
Latin class-books worthy ol, and suitable to, the spants and wishes
os the age, we bave deemed it proper to abendon the grammata
