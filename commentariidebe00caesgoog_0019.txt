rowed money: his popularity became immense, and was increased
by the manner in which he contrived on every occasion to humble
the pride of the aristocracy. One morning, the trophies and statues
ol Marius, which had been removed from the Capitol‘by Sulla, were
found restored to their places. Every one knew that this was Cacsar’s
doing, and the people were delighted at the reappearauce of the
monuments of their great champion‚ while the senatorial party,
though alanned in the highest degree, and apprehending nothing
short os a revolution, did not dare to challerrge his conduct. After
his aedileship he continued to annoy the partisans of the senate in
various ways, but chiefly by bringing accusations against those who
were guilty of crimes committed under the protection ol the lavvs of
Sulla. This, however, he did, not so much with tha intention ol'
bringing those persons to punishment, as of preventing the senatorial
party from any further summary or unconstitutional proceedings
against the popular party. ln nc. 63 he was elected chief pontiff,

of the tribunes were suspended'by the senate from their cilices, but

Gaesar's conduct on that occasion was so well calculated, and so pru·

dent, that the senate in the end was obliged to apologiae sor its hasty
measure, and publicly to thanlt him sorbis moderatiora. This was

a great humiliation sor the aristocratic party, but they had brought

lt upon themselves. In the same year Caesar divorced his wil'a

Pompeia, having discovered that she was carrying on an intrigua

with the notorious P. Clodius; but he did not prosecute the offender¹
because he was very popular, and a man of great importunos ta
