From Pras. N. ιιιιιιιριαιι, medam, Mara, May 12, 185³.

rt would ιιοι become me ιο speaker the selentifie merite οι such a work by
such an author; but I may be allowed ιο say, ιιιιι Ι mest earnestly wlsh that ιι
night supersede every hook used as a tert-hook on Astronomy in all our instita·
ιιοιιι, except perhaps those where ιι is studied mathematically.

We n ιι lake leave of this remarkable work, which we hod ιο be hevond ι
άοιιιιι the greatest and ιιιοιι remarkable οι t⁵he works ln which the lawa af
as ιιοιιοιιιι and the appearance of the heavene are described ιο those who are ιιιιι
ιιι ‚rall- ena ιιιιιιιιι nor observers, and resalled ιο those who are. ιιΙ ιι the reward
