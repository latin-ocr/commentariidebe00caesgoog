A'sia Minor in submission to Rome. Before the end of the year
he returned home, having bean elected pontiff in the place of his
nucia, (J. Aurelius Cotta. Upon his arrival, he used every means
toincrease his‘ popularity3 and aa his property was not large,
he borrowed money from the usurers, who willingly gave him
'what he demanded, though they had no security except his
bonesty‚ and the prospect that soma public office might afford
him tha means of paying his debts. Not long after, ha was elected
by the people one of the tribunes of the soldiers, though we da
not know whether he fought in any of tha wars which were then
carried on against Mithridates, Sertorius, and Spartacus. Itis
certain, however, that he acted a prominent partin the upsettiug
of the Sullanian institutione, which was brought about by Pompey
and L. Aurelius Gotta3 and this was sufficient to establish him
in the popular favour. In a. e. 68 he obtained the quaestorship,

objecta in view, he supported him in all his undertakings, and
took no small share in obtaining· for him the command in the
war against the pirates, and afterwards in that against Mithri·
dates.

In a. c. 65 he was elected curule aedile. lt had been customary,
for a long time, for persons antering on this office, to endeavour
to gain popularity by entertaining the people with splendid gamer
and public amusements, and so secure their favour and support
in the electione for higher uffices. Although Caesar had no great
means of his own, his aedileship surpassed in splendour and magni-
ficence ali that had ever been seen at Rome. His liberality was
boundless; and in the gamas which were celebrated in the circus,
there appeared three hundred and twenty· pairs of gladiatore, all
equipped rn the most costly manner. All this was done with bor·
