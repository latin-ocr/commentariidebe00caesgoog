INTRODUO'I'ION.

Gerus Junrus classa, one of the most distinguished characian
in Roman history, was the son of 0. Julius Caesar and Aurelia-
awoman not unworthy of being ranhed with Cornelia, the mother
of the Gracchi-and was born on the leth of Quintilis (dely), in
the year a. o. 100. He lost his father et the ege of sixteen, hut
his mother was still living at the time of his victorious career
in Gaul. By her his education was superintended with the utmost
care; and the facility with which he comprehended the most diffi-
cult subjecta submitted to him, and the scel he displayed in the
acquisitiones knowledge, produced a strong conviction that he
would one day exercise great influence on the affairs of his
country. chond this, little is known respecting his early youth,

The period at which Caesar appeared was towards the close of the

had just achiavod a signal triumph over Marius, the leeder of tha
popular party, and had been raised to the dictatorship-an office
which gave him the first authority in the state, and enabled him to
exercise the most tyrannio sway. Caesar, both from inclination
and from family connexion, joined the popular party, and thus
incurred the hetred of Sulla, who had already regarded him with
jcalousy, on account of his connexion with Marius, who was mar-
ried to hie aunt Julia. This dislilre at length found vent, when
Caesar, in a. o. 83, married Cornelia, daughter of L. Cinna, another
uf the politicel opponente of the newly·appointed dictator. Sulla
now commanded Caesar to divorce Comeliu3 but the young hero
resolutely defied the order, and refused to part> with his belovsd wife
-an act of daring recisurae, for at this time all Rome trembled before
the tyrant. In consequence of this conduct, Caesar was deprived of
