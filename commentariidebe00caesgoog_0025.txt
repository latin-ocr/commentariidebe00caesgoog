succeeding at Dyrrhachium, he ventured upon a step, which in bolo.
nese surpassed everything he had hitherto attempted. He set out for
Ι Thessaly, haviug to pass through countries where he had to fight for
every inch of ground, while he was pursued by Pompey's army. 'Phe
conduct of the latter bad hitherto been cautious and circumspect, but
he and his friends being flushed with their recent victory, resolved tn
decide the matter'by a great blow. Caesar encamped in the plain of
Pharsalus, and when Pompey came up and offered battle, he readily
accepted it. Pompey's army was more than double that of his ene·
my, but his soldiers were effeminate nobles and inexperienced youths;
and the great battle, which was fought on the eru of August, n. e.
te, ended in the total defeat of Pompey, who fled to Egypt, where he
was treacherously murdered The news of this victory called forth
euch enthusiastic' yoy at Rome, that Caesar was appointed dictator
fur a whole year, and' mvest ted with the power of tribune for tife; he
. was also elected consul for the next five years, but this extraordinary
distinction he declined. After the battle, he pursued Pompey to
Egypt, aud when he found that he was no more, his generous soulis
said to have been moved to tears. Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, corn·
pletely won the conqueror’s heart, and his attempts to settle the af·
fairs of her disturbed kingdom involved himin awar, (commonly
called the Alexandrina) in which, for a time, he was exposed to the
greatest danger3 but when his reinforcements arrived, he succeeded
in placing Cleopatra upon the throne. In a. o. 47, he marched
through Syria to Pontus, to chastise Pharnaces, who had defeated
ene of his legates. The Parthian king was utterly defeated at the
first encounter, and without much difficulty. After this victory, he
sent to Rome the laconic but expressiva report: “I carne, saw, and
conquered !'’ (“ Veni, uidi, uiei'.‘'’) Hereupon he returned to Rome,
where, by the sale of the property of Pompey aud several other eris·
tocrats, he obtained the means of rewarding his soldiers and friends.
For the same purpose he increased the number of quaestore, while
he also caused himself to be appointed dictator for the next year.
After remaining at Rome for a few months, he sut out for Africa
towards tha end of a. c. 473 for Cato and Scipio had there col-
lected a numerous army of the Pompeian party, and threatened
to become formidable; but the battle of Thapsus, iu April, u. c. 46,
decided their fate iu Africa3 and Cato, who could not endure to
survive tha fall of the republic, put au end to his own life at
Utica. 'I'he Pompeian party was now utterly destroyed, and
, ansar was the undisputed master of the whole of the Roman
world. Before his retumto Rome, every oue dreaded a repe-
tition of the horrore committed in the days of Marius and Sulla,
bot these feors were groundlesu for cruelty and revauge formed
