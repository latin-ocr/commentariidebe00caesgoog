As a general, Caesar had from tbe first displayed all the quali·
ties ot a great military genius3 aad though, in the province of Gaul,
he sacrificed the lives of thousands of barbariam without remorso, yet
throughout bis civil wara be shewed a generosity and mildness
towards his vanquished opponente which filled those who had seen
the fearful days of Marius and Sulla with admiration aad affection.
For the display of his statesmanship he had little time3 bat what he
did, is enough to show what he would heve accomplished, if he had
been permitted to carry out his plans.

Perhaps the most surprising circumstance in Caesar's career, is the
fact that, notwithstanding his extraordinary activity ever after hia
entering upon public life, he found leisure to cultivate the arte aud
literature, and to composa works which, like those of Cicero, gave
the literary tone and character to that period, and which to this day
are ranhed among the finest specimens of ancient literature. Unfor-
tunately‚ the greater number of them are fastand only a few isolated
passages remaln, which ara occasionally quoted by later writers. He
was also one of the first oratore of his age, and we possess a long
catalogue of sabjecta an which be spoke in publio. But it was not
only the history and politica of his own time which engaged his at·
tention: there was nothing capable of furnishing materiale sor the
human mind to reflect upon, which did not at one time or another
occupy him; and among his many worlts, there was ane even on
grammar, which is often quoted as aa authority by tho later gram·
mariana of Rome. In short, Caesar must be pronoanced to have
been a universal genius: he was great not only as a general, but as
ι statesman, a lawgiver, a jurist, en orator, a poet, en historian, a

Ι scholar, a mathematician, andan architect. „

and Civil ware, under the title of Commentarii-that is, diaries or
journals. Their style is distinguished for its noble slmplicity, trans·
parent clearness and precision, as well as perfect freedom from all
rhetorical pomp. They are, in fact, specimens of what the language
of conversation among men ofeducation and talant was in those times;
and the few peculiarities and irregularities which their style presente
are, on the whole, nothing but what msy' be termed conversational
licenaes, showing a total absence of everything studied and formal.
The substance af these works was probably written down during the
campaigns themselves, and they were afterwards revised in tha time
which their author spent in winter quarters. 'l'he Commentarii of
