tration by 8 refusal, despatched the legions, though he knew that, m
all probability, they were intended to serve against himself. Some
time alter this, he took up his winter quarters at Ravenna, the
southernmost town ol Cisalpine Gaul, and close upon the confines
of Italy. Having there learned from Curio the real state es affairs,
he sent him with a conciliatory letter to the serrata. When Curio
arrived at Rome, the senate could hardly be prevailad upon to allow
the letter to be read t 8ηά alter some violent discussion, it was agreed
that, unless Caesar should disband his army before a certain day, he
should be treated as a public enemy. Two tribunes interposed their
veto, but to no purpose; and as even their lives were threatened,
they fled in disguise to Caesar at Ravenna, calhng upon him to pro-
tect the sacred character ol the tribuneship. The senate, entirely
relying upon Pompey, who never drearnt of the possibility os Caesar
taking up arms against him, and who sancied that it required only
his word to muse all Italy to arms, commanded the consuls to pro·
vide for the salety of the republic. War was now declared, and the
whole management ol it intrusted to Pompey. But the aristocracy
bad miscalculated: Pompey, in his sels-sufficiency, had neglected
every precaution‚ end his party was so unpopular,that it was scarcely

When Cacsar was informed by the tribunes os the last decree of
the senate, he assembled the lew troops he had with him, (for his
main army was still beyond the Alps) and set out towards the small

crossed the river. 'Phe consideration of his own salety compelled him
to eet as he did: there was no alternative. Aa he marched south·

was like an uninterrupted triumph. The sear 8ηά alarm at Rome
became so great, that the senate, with Pompey at their head, fled from
the city to Capua, aud thence to Brundusium, lorgetting in their
hurty even to take with them the eontants os the public treasury.
Caesar met with no resistence till he came to Corfinium, but as
Pompey did not corne to the relies of the town, it surrendered3 end
the clemency 8ηά generosity with which tha conqueror herc. as else-

and admiration os all. Pompey, who was resolved to quit ltaly,
reached Brundusium before Caesar, and onthe17thol March he
embarlred ser Greece. As Caesar had no fleet, he was'unable to
pursue him; 8ηά he accordingly returned, end determined first to
